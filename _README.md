# amoeba
Supporting data on amoeba force field parameters for ionic liquids.

This directory contains the amoeba force field parameters for the anion NTf2-
(amoeba_ntf2.prm) developed by C. Cervinka in 2019 following the public protocol,
described on the page https://sites.google.com/site/amoebaworkshop/.

The developed parameters were used in our MD simulations of the fusion enthalpy
of ionic liquids, the results of which were published in Klajmon & Cervinka,
Does Explicit Polarizability Improve Simulations of Phase Behavior of Ionic
Liquids? J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00518.
